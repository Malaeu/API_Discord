## Installation Context

Discord apps can be installed in two different contexts:

1. Apps installed **to a server** (called a [guild](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD) in the API) by a user with the Manage Server ([`MANAGE_GUILD`](#DOCS_TOPICS_PERMISSIONS/permissions-bitwise-permission-flags)) permission. Apps installed to a server can only be used within that server and DMs with the app, and are visible to all server members.
2. Apps installed **to a user account**. Apps installed to a user are visible *only* to that user, across all of their servers, DMs, and Group DMs. Apps installed to a user have [limited functionality](#TODO)â€”for example, they cannot take actions on behalf of the installing user (like updating settings, sending messages, or creating new channels).

The installation contexts that an app supports can be limited by the developer when [setting up the app](#DOCS_RESOURCES_APPLICATION/setting-supported-installation-contexts). Details about installation contexts are in the [Application resource documentation](#DOCS_RESOURCES_APPLICATION/installation-context).

## Discord APIs

There are a handful of different APIs that you can pick and choose from based on your app's functionality and which Discord features you want to access. Below is a quick overview of the main APIs on the Discord developer platform, but you can read more details and information about API usage in the [API reference](#DOCS_QUICK_START/API_REFERENCE).

### HTTP API

The **HTTP API** is a REST API that lets you interact and modify core Discord resources like [channels](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL), [servers (or guilds)](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD), [users](#DOCS_RESOURCES_user), and [messages](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object). 

Use the HTTP API to:
- Retrieve information about a resource
- Create, update, or delete a resource

Read details about using the HTTP API in the [API reference](#DOCS_QUICK_START/API_REFERENCE/http-api).

### Gateway API

The **Gateway API** lets you receive event data over a WebSocket anytime an [event](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS) occurs in a server where your app is installed.

Use the Gateway API to:
- Receive events happening in Discord

Read details about using the Gateway API in the [API reference](#DOCS_QUICK_START/API_REFERENCE/gateway-websocket-api).
