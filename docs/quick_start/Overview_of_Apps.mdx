## Discord APIs

There are a handful of different APIs that you can pick and choose from based on your app's functionality and which Discord features you want to access. Below is a quick overview of the main APIs on the Discord developer platform, but you can read more details and information about API usage in the [API reference](#DOCS_QUICK_START/API_REFERENCE).

### HTTP API

The **HTTP API** is a REST API that lets you interact and modify core Discord resources like [channels](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL), [servers (or guilds)](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD), [users](#DOCS_RESOURCES_user), and [messages](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object). 

Use the HTTP API to:
- Retrieve information about a resource
- Create, update, or delete a resource

Read details about using the HTTP API in the [API reference](#DOCS_QUICK_START/API_REFERENCE/http-api).

### Gateway API

The **Gateway API** lets you receive event data over a WebSocket anytime an [event](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS) occurs in a server where your app is installed.

Use the Gateway API to:
- Receive events happening in Discord

Read details about using the Gateway API in the [API reference](#DOCS_QUICK_START/API_REFERENCE/gateway-websocket-api).
