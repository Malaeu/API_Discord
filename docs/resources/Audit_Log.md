# Audit Logs Resource

## Audit Logs

Whenever an administrative action is performed in a guild, an entry is added to its audit log. Viewing audit logs requires the `VIEW_AUDIT_LOG` permission and can be fetched by apps using the [`GET /guilds/{guild.id}/audit-logs` endpoint](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUDIT_LOG/get-guild-audit-log), or viewed by users in the guild's Server Settings. All audit log entries are stored for 45 days.

When an app is performing an administrative action using the APIs, it can specify a reason for the action using the `X-Audit-Log-Reason` request header, which will be stored as the [entry's](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUDIT_LOG/audit-log-entry-object) `reason` field. The `X-Audit-Log-Reason` header supports URL-encoded UTF-8 characters.

\* Threads referenced in `THREAD_CREATE` and `THREAD_UPDATE` events are included in the threads map since archived threads might not be kept in memory by clients.

### Audit Log Entry Object

Each audit log entry represents a single administrative action (or event), indicated by the `action_type`. Each entry contains one to many changes in the `changes` array that affected a resource in Discordâ€”whether that's a user, channel, app, emoji, or something else.

The information (and structure) of a single entry will be different depending on the action type, the changes made, and the context of those changes. For example, when a member is added or removed from a role (`MEMBER_ROLE_UPDATE` event), there is only one change: the member is either added or removed from a specific role. But when a channel is created (`CHANNEL_CREATE` event), there are many changes in the audit log entry including but not limited to properties like the name, type of channel, and permission overwrites added during creation.

###### Audit Log Events

The table below documents audit log events, and their corresponding `action_type` values, that your app may receive.

The object changed column corresponds with that object's change keys, which are documented in the [Change Object](#TODO) section. An `N/A` means there isn't a `changes` array in the event's entry (though there is still a `target_id` for the affected entity).
