## Audit Logs

When an administrative action is performed in a guild, an entry is added to its audit log. Viewing audit logs requires the `VIEW_AUDIT_LOG` permission and can be fetched by apps using the [`GET /guilds/{guild.id}/audit-logs` endpoint](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUDIT_LOG/get-guild-audit-log), or seen by users in the guild's **Server Settings**. All audit log entries are stored for 45 days.

When an app is performing an eligible action using the APIs, it can pass an `X-Audit-Log-Reason` header to indicate why the action was taken. More information is in the [audit log entry](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUDIT_LOG/audit-log-entry-object) section.

| threads                | array of thread-specific [channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object) objects                           | List of threads found in the audit log\*                    |

\* Threads referenced in `THREAD_CREATE` and `THREAD_UPDATE` events are included in the threads map since archived threads might not be kept in memory by clients.

###### Example Partial Integration Object

```json
{
  "id": "33590653072239123",
  "name": "A Name",
  "type": "twitch",
  "account": {
    "name": "twitchusername",
    "id": "1234567"
  },
  "application_id": "94651234501213162"
}
```

### Audit Log Entry Object

Each audit log entry represents a single administrative action (or [event](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUDIT_LOG/audit-log-entry-object-audit-log-events)), indicated by `action_type`. Each entry contains one to many changes in the `changes` array that affected an entity in Discordâ€”whether that's a user, channel, guild, emoji, or something else.

The information (and structure) of an entry's changes will be different depending on its type. For example, in `MEMBER_ROLE_UPDATE` events there is only one change: a member is either added or removed from a specific role. However, in `CHANNEL_CREATE` events there are many changes, including but not limited to the channel's name, type, and permission overwrites added. More details are in the [change object](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUDIT_LOG/audit-log-change-object) section.

Apps can specify why an administrative action is being taken by passing an `X-Audit-Log-Reason` request header, which will be stored as the audit log entry's `reason` field. The `X-Audit-Log-Reason` header supports 1-512 URL-encoded UTF-8 characters. The entry's reason is visible to users in the client and when fetching audit log entries with the API.

> warn
> For `APPLICATION_COMMAND_PERMISSION_UPDATE` events, the `target_id` is the app ID since the `changes` array may contain several permission changes for different individual entities

###### Audit Log Events

The table below documents audit log events, and their corresponding `action_type` values, that your app may receive.

The **Object Changed** column corresponds with that object that's changed. Though there are exceptions, the possible keys in the `changes` array usually correspond to the object's fields, which can be found in its linked documentation.

If no object is noted, it means that there isn't a `changes` array in the entry, though other fields like the `target_id` still exist and many have fields in the [`options` array](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUDIT_LOG/audit-log-entry-object-optional-audit-entry-info).

### Audit Log Change Object

Many audit log events include a `changes` array in their [entry object](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUDIT_LOG/audit-log-entry-object-audit-log-entry-structure). The structure for the individual changes varies based on the event type and its changed objects, so apps shouldn't depend on a single pattern of handling audit log events.

###### Audit Log Change Structure

> warn
> `APPLICATION_COMMAND_PERMISSIONS_UPDATE` and `MEMBER_ROLE_UPDATE` events don't follow the same pattern as other audit log events. Details can be found in the [change key](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUDIT_LOG/audit-log-change-object-audit-log-change-key-exceptions) section.

> info
> If `new_value` is not present in the change object while `old_value` is, it indicates that the changed property has been reset or set to `null`.

| Field      | Type                                                                            | Description                                                                                                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| new_value? | [mixed](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUDIT_LOG/audit-log-change-object-audit-log-change-key) | New value of the key                                                                                                          |
| old_value? | [mixed](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUDIT_LOG/audit-log-change-object-audit-log-change-key) | Old value of the key                                                                                                          |
| key        | string                                                                          | Name of the changed entity |

###### Audit Log Change Key Exceptions

For most objects, the change keys can be any field included on the object, and the types and descriptions can be found in the respective documentation. The following table details possible exceptions to this pattern for select objects. 

> info
> IDs that aren't in the object's payload refer to nested IDs. For example, the `channel_id` change key for invite objects corresponds to its `channel` object's `id` field.

| Object Changed                                                                                                                                   | Change Key Exceptions                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| [Command Permission](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS/application-command-permissions-object-application-command-permissions-structure)\* | only snowflake                           |
| [Invite](#DOCS_RESOURCES_INVITE/invite-object) and [Invite Metadata](#DOCS_RESOURCES_INVITE/invite-metadata-object)                              | `channel_id` instead of a channel object |
| [Partial Role](#DOCS_TOPICS_PERMISSIONS/role-object)\*\*                                                                                         | onlu `$add` and `$remove`                |
| [Webhook](#DOCS_RESOURCES_WEBHOOK/webhook-object)                                                                                                | `avatar_hash`                            |

\* `APPLICATION_COMMAND_PERMISSIONS_UPDATE` events use a snowflake as the change key. The `changes` array contains objects with a `key` field representing the entity whose command was affected (role, channel, or user ID), a previous permissions object (with an `old_value` key), and an updated permissions object (with a `new_value` key).

\*\* `MEMBER_ROLE_UPDATE` events use `$add` and `$remove` as the change keys. `new_value` is an array of objects that contain the role `id` and `name`.

## Get Guild Audit Log % GET /guilds/{guild.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/guild-object}/audit-logs

Returns an [audit log](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUDIT_LOG/audit-log-object) object for the guild. Requires the [`VIEW_AUDIT_LOG`](#DOCS_TOPICS_PERMISSIONS/permissions-bitwise-permission-flags) permission.

###### Query String Params

| limit       | integer   | Maximum number of entries (between 1-100) to return, defaults to 50                                         |
