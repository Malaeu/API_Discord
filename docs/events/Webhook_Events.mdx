# Webhook Events

Webhook events are one-way events sent to your app over HTTP to notify you when an event occured. Unlike events that are [sent over Gateway connections](#TODO), events sent over webhooks are not realtime or guaranteed to be in order.

While [outgoing webhooks](#DOCS_RESOURCES_WEBHOOK) are triggered by an external service, webhook events (i.e. incoming webhooks) are triggered by events happening in Discord. Since your app is the one receiving the events over HTTP, you need to set up a URL and subscribe to events. TODO.

## Subscribing to Events

To configure webhook events, you'll need to configure your URL and select the events you want your app to receive.

In your [app's settings](https://discord.com/developers/applications), navigate to the **Webhooks** page from the left-hand sidebar then complete the following:

1. Under **Endpoint**, add a public [Webhook Events URL](#TODO) that is set up to receive and acknowledge webhook events
2. Enable Events by clicking the toggle in the **Events** section
3. Select the [webhook events](#DOCS_EVENTS_WEBHOOK_EVENTS/event-types) you want your app to receive
4. Click **Save Changes**

If your URL is successfully verified, your app should begin receiving the events you selected.

## Responding to Events

When your Webhook Event URL receives a webhook event, your app should respond with a `200` (Success) status code **within 3 seconds** to indicate that you successfully received it.

If your app doesn't respond to the webhook event, Discord will retry sending it several times using exponential backoff for up to 10 minutes. TODO: verify

If your app doesn't acknowledge that it received events, Discord will consider your endpoint inactive and eventually stop sending new events. TODO: verify

## Webhook Event Payloads

Webhook events are wrapped in an outer payload, with an inner `event` object.
