## Applications (aka Apps)

Making an app on Discord opens up many possibilities for deeper integrations with your other services and platforms.
Here are some examples to whet your appetite:

* Using your Discord account to safely login to your guild's website
* Display who’s online or in-game on your website or forum
* Automatically join private Discord servers or gain new roles based on external website permissions
* Other neat things.

Head over to our new [applications page](#MY_APPLICATIONS/top) to dive into creating your own custom juice.


## Airhorn Solutions - Bot #0

On April 1st we launched [Airhorn Solutions](https://airhorn.solutions) to bring upon chaos to this meek world.

Now that the noise has subsided, we’ve [open-sourced the source code for Airhorn Solutions](https://github.com/hammerandchisel/airhornbot). It’s the first fully-functional bot built with our initial API launch. If you’re looking for a working example of our API, we highly suggest digging in.

There is an [active unofficial community-driven Discord Server for devs](https://discordapp.com/invite/0SBTUU1wZTUzBx2q). Come hang out if you wanna chat with other devs and see what’s being cranked out.

We look forward to seeing what you make!
