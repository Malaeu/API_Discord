# Branches and Builds

> danger
> The Discord Store is still in a beta period. All documentation and functionality can and will change.

In order for other people to download your game from Discord's servers, you need to _upload_ your game to Discord's servers. Let's learn how to do that!

## Getting Set Up

First, get Dispatch. If you don't already have it, ask us for access!

You'll want to be able to use Dispatch across your projects, so let's handle that now by adding it to our PATH.

**MacOS/Linux:**

Bust out those \*nix skills.

- Open your choice of terminal
- Stick dispatch in a folder that will be added to your PATH. If you don't have a good spot for this stuff already, you can `mkdir ~/bin/` and call that Dispatch's new home (as well as any other executables you might want to access in the future)
- Add that ~/bin directory to your path in a permanent way. I have `export PATH=$PATH:~/bin` at the bottom of my `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.bashrc`
- Restart your terminal
- `echo $PATH` and make sure you see the directory in the output

You're good! You can now call the dispatch command from anywhere!

**Windows**

Not as 1337 as some scripting skillz, but the Windows GUI will do just fine

- Stick dispatch in a folder that will be added to your PATH
- Hit that Windows key and start typing "Environment Variables"
- Select "Edit the system environment variables"
- Hit the "Environment Variables" button in the bottom right
- Edit the PATH entry for either the system or the current user, adding dispatch's directory
- Restart your command line

You're good! You can now call the dispatch command from anywhere!

> Want some really fancy skills? You can set up autocompletions for dispatch in whatever shell you work.

## Authorizing Yourself to Use It

Run `dispatch login`, which will open a web browser and prompt you to authorize your Discord account with Dispatch.

Yup, that's it.

ONWARDS!

## Creating Branches

> During development time, we ask that you DO NOT create your own OAuth2 application. When you are ready to begin development, let someone on the Discord team know, and we will create an application for you and assign it to your account. We have some special flags that we need to enable on your behalf.

Now that we're set up to use the tool, let's make some branches! Branches, builds, and everything in between in Discord are tied to an application. To get one for your game, ask a Discord team member to hook you up!

Then, head over to our [developer portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/), click into that new application, and copy the `Client Id` at the top of the page, keeping it handy throughout this process. Client ID and "application id" are interchangeable phrases. For the rest of this documentation, we'll refer to it as application id.

Back to your terminal, type:

```
dispatch branch create <application_id> <branch_name>
```

This will create a named branch under that application id that can be pushed to. You can see your branches with:

```
dispatch branch list <application_id>
```

## Setting Up Our First Build

In order for Discord to understand what you're sending, you need to set up a config file for your game. This config file tells Discord which files to bundle together, how to run them, and other metadata to include. You should keep this file safe in your version control system of choice; that way, Discord is always up to date with whatever you've got locally. You'll reference these manifests later when building your store pages, so that Discord knows what to download to someone's computer when they hit that Big Buy Button.

Let's break an example `config.json` file down into pieces, and then put it together at the end.

```js
{
  "application": {
    "id": 467102538279999224,
    "manifests": []
  }
}
```

This is the top level of the config file. It has an `application` object at the top. `id` is your application id. `manifests` are the heart of this file, and offer a lot of customization for tagging and uploading data for the build. Let's jump into that now.

```js
{
  "label": "my-awesome-game/windows",
  "platforms": ["win32", "win64"],
  "locales": [],
  "local_root": "./game-files/windows",
  "redistributables": [
    "directx_june_2010"
  ]
}
```

`manifests` is an array of objects that denote file bundles; part of that object is listed here. `label` is the name you want to give an individual manifest/bundle of files. `platforms` are the platforms for which it is valid. `locales` is an array of locales for which the manifest is valid; leaving it empty denotes it's valid for all locales. `local_root` is the relative path from this file to the directory that contains the raw game files to upload. `redistributables` is an array of any redistributable packages your game may need to function, like a certain install of DirectX, or a Microsoft C++ redistributable. A list of valid values can be found in [Field Values](#DOCS_DISPATCH_FIELD_VALUES/).

```js
{
  "file_rules": {
    "mappings": [
      {
        "local_path": ".",
        "install_path": "."
      },
      {
        "local_path": "./languages/en-US/no-but-the-data-is-really-in-here/"
        "install_path": "./english"
      }
    ],
    "properties": [
      {
        "install_path": "save/*",
        "attributes": ["user_data"]
      }
    ],
    "exclusions": [
      {
        "local_path": "**/*.pdb"
      },
      {
        "local_path": "server_distribution/linux/*"
      },
      {
        "local_path": "client_distribution/linux/*"
      },
      {
        "local_path": "client_distribution/osx/*"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This is another subset of a manifest object, `file_rules`. `file_rules` allows you to mark certain globs of files with certain tags, so Dispatch can handle them specially.

`mappings` lets you tell Dispatch to download files to a certain place in the install directory on a user's machine, letting you create the folder structure you need.

`properties` allows you to mark properties on globs of files. In this case, marking a glob of files as `"user_data"` tells Dispatch not to touch these files in any way if it sees them; don't want that save data overwritten!

`exclusions` also allow you to mark off globs of files. Files globs here will not be uploaded by Dispatch on a build push. In the above example, debug files that match the `*.pdb` pattern in any directory will be ignored. We also explicitly ignore linux and osx server and client distributables, since this manifest is for Windows.

> Dispatch supports [Rust globbing patterns](https://docs.rs/glob/0.2.11/glob/struct.Pattern.html).

```js
{
  "launch_commands": {
    "win32": {
      "executable": "client_distribution/win32/starbound.exe",
      "arguments": []
    },
    "win64": {
      "executable": "client_distribution/win64/starbound.exe",
      "arguments": []
    }
  }
}
```

The last bit of the config file is the launch commands for your game. Here, you should specify the executables for the platforms for this manifest (if there are any) and any arguments they require.

Let's see what one looks like all together!

```js
{
  "application": {
    "id": 467102538279999224,
    "drm": true,
    "manifests": [
      {
        "label": "my-awesome-game/windows",
        "platforms": ["win32", "win64"],
        "locales": [],
        "local_root": "./",
        "file_rules": {
          "properties": [
            {
              "install_path": "save/*",
              "attributes": ["user_data"]
            }
          ],
          "exclusions": [
            {
              "local_path": "**/*.pdb"
            },
            {
              "local_path": "server_distribution/linux/*"
            },
            {
              "local_path": "client_distribution/linux/*"
            },
            {
              "local_path": "client_distribution/osx/*"
            }
          ]
        },
        "launch_commands": {
          "win32": {
            "executable": "client_distribution/win32/starbound.exe",
            "arguments": []
          },
          "win64": {
            "executable": "client_distribution/win64/starbound.exe",
            "arguments": []
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## DRM

You can choose to add DRM to your game. Dispatch will wrap your executables and prevent a user from launching the game if they are not logged into Discord.

> danger
> This is a destructive operation. It will wrap your executable in place. It will not back up your executable. Make sure you have a backup somewhere else.

If you understand and agree to the above, run the following command on each of the executables you want to wrap.

```
dispatch build drm-wrap <application_id> <path_to_executable_to_wrap>
```

## Pushing Our First Build

We've got all our files ready for processing; let's ship this baby!

```
dispatch build push <branch_id> <path_to_config> <path_to_files_to_upload>
```

You'll see a bunch of request logging as it gets sent up to Discord—when it's done, you're greeted with a friendly completion message:

```
[2018-06-14][11:38:51][INFO] Pushed build. build_id=456889899375656960
```

To double check that it's all ready for publishing, run:

```
dispatch build list <application_id> <branch_id>
```

You'll see a table with the current status of your builds. Once the one you uploaded is marked as READY, you're good to publish it to the masses!

## Publishing Our First Build

Once you're ready to make a build live, run:

```
dispatch build publish <application_id> <branch_id> <build_id>
```

To make sure it worked, you can again run:

```
dispatch branch list <application_id>
```

And look for a `LIVE_BUILD_ID` under your application!

## Patching

If you need to push out a patch or a new build, no problem! Just repeat the process:

- Update your game files locally to whatever they need to be
- Push your build again
- Publish the build again
- List your branches to make sure the new build is live

Discord will do some magic in the background to diff your files, ensuring that your players only have to download the changes they need and letting them do it quickly so they can get back in the game. Or, really, without them even needing to know there _was_ a patch! Your players will automatically download your latest and greatest stuff, and quickly!

Now that you've got a game in the system, let's [create a store page](#DOCS_DISPATCH_MANAGING_STORE_LISTINGS) for it!
