To help keep us focused on the features, improvements, and gaming-related experiences that Discord users love, we are deprecating the following pieces of the GameSDK **starting today**, and decommissioning them on **Tuesday, May 2, 2023**:

* [Achievements](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_GAME_SDK/achievements)
* [Applications](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_GAME_SDK/applications)
* [Voice](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_GAME_SDK/voice)
* [Images](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_GAME_SDK/images)
* [Lobbies](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_GAME_SDK/lobbies)
* [Networking](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_GAME_SDK/networking)
* [Storage](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_GAME_SDK/storage)
* [Store](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_GAME_SDK/store) \[purchases and discounts]

This deprecation period will last until **Tuesday May 2, 2023**, after which these pieces will be decommissioned and no longer work. The other pieces of the GameSDK will continue to be supported.

We know that Discord is an important place for people to find belonging, and that using your Discord identity in games is a crucial part of that sense of belonging. Youâ€™ll still be able to use the GameSDK to integrate Rich Presence, relationships, entitlements, basic user information, and the overlay.
