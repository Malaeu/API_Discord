# Implementing App Subscriptions

Charge users for premium app functionality with a recurring user or guild subscription.

- Before you can add an app subscription to your app, you must complete the [Monetization Eligibility Checklist](#DOCS_MONETIZATION_OVERVIEW/eligibility-checklist).
- Once you've confirmed eligibility for your app and team, you will be able to set up a [SKU](#DOCS_RESOURCES_SKU) (stock-keeping unit) to represent your subscription.


---

## Types of Subscriptions

When creating subscriptions, you will need to choose between user or guild subscriptions:

- **User Subscriptions**: Offers premium features to an individual user across any server where your app installed.
- **Guild Subscriptions**: Provides premium benefits to all members within a specific server.

> **Have multiple subscriptions?** We are currently working on support for developers to offer multiple types of subscriptions. Stay tuned for updates.

## How App Subscriptions Work

- Subscriptions on Discord grant an [Entitlement](#DOCS_RESOURCES_ENTITLEMENT) to a user that grants them access to a specific [SKU](#DOCS_RESOURCES_SKU).
- When a user purchases your subscription SKU, Discord creates an Entitlement for the user (or guild) and that specific Subscription SKU. 
- You will receive an `ENTITLEMENT_CREATE` event via the Gateway.
- This entitlement is now available via the `LIST Entitlements` API endpoint.
- This entitlement will be available on `Interaction Payloads` initiated from the entitled user or users in a guild (for guild subscriptions).
- This subscription will be available via the `LIST Subscriptions` API endpoint.
- This entitlement is granted indefinitely until the user decides to cancel their subscription.
- When a user cancels their subscription, you will receive an `ENTITLEMENT_UPDATE` event with an `ends_at` timestamp representing when the subscription ends and when related premium functionality should be revoked.
- If the user changes their mind and reactivates their subscription, you will receive another `ENTITLEMENT_UPDATE` event setting the `ends_at` timestamp to null.

## Configuring App Subscriptions

Once you have an idea what type of subscription you want to offer for your app, you can create and [customize your SKU](#DOCS_MONETIZATION_MANAGING_YOUR_STORE/customizing-your-skus) to reflect the premium features that you are adding to your app. This is a good place to outline the benefits your users will receive from having an app subscription.

Once an app has a published SKU, there are 4 ways users will be able to subscribe:

- Server admins can use the **Integrations** tab within a server's settings menu
- Bot user profiles include an Upgrade button
- App Directory profiles offer a Premium tab containing subscription details and an Upgrade option
- Attempting to run a premium command will display the Upgrade button in the response

If you don't have any premium commands, your users will still be able to upgrade to your premium app via the Integrations settings menu, bot user profiles and App Directory profiles.

## Implementing App Subscriptions

When a user subscribes to your app, there are a few things you will need to implement in your code to check for subscription status and access.

- Working with Entitlements
- Handling Gateway Events for Entitlements
- Using the Entitlement API
- Gating your App with Premium Interactions
- Using the Subscription API for Lifecycle Management
---

### Working with Entitlements

When a user purchases a subscription, an entitlement is created. [Entitlements](#DOCS_RESOURCES_ENTITLEMENT) represent the user's access to your premium offering. You can keep track of entitlements using Gateway Events and the HTTP API.

### Handling Gateway Events for Entitlements

When users subscribe or renew a subscription with your app, Discord will emit [Entitlement gateway events](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/entitlements).

- `ENTITLEMENT_CREATE`: When a user subscribes to your app.
- `ENTITLEMENT_UPDATE`: When a user renews their subscription.
- `ENTITLEMENT_DELETE`: When Discord refunds a subscription or removes an entitlement and when a developer [deletes a Test Entitlement](#DOCS_RESOURCES_ENTITLEMENT/delete-test-entitlement).

> danger
> **Starting on October 1st, 2024**, the `ENTITLEMENT_CREATE` and `ENTITLEMENT_UPDATE` event behavior is changing. Please see the [Change Log and Entitlement Migration Guide](#DOCS_CHANGE_LOG/subscription-api-and-upcoming-entitlement-migration) for more information on what is changing and how to prepare.

### Using the Entitlement API

For apps requiring background processing or not solely reliant on interactions, keeping track of entitlements is essential. You can utilize the [List Entitlements](#DOCS_RESOURCES_ENTITLEMENT/list-entitlements) endpoint to list active and expired entitlements. Your app can filter entitlements by a specific user or guild by using the `?user_id=XYZ` or `?guild_Id=XYZ` query params.

For example, you might keep track of our entitlements in a database and check a user's subscription status before performing a cron job or other task.

### Checking Entitlements in Interactions

Each interaction payload includes an `entitlements` field containing an array of full [entitlement objects](#DOCS_RESOURCES_ENTITLEMENT/entitlement-object). You can use this field to determine if the user or guild is subscribed to your app. 

### Prompting Users to Upgrade

If the user or guild is not subscribed and you wish to present them with a option to doing so, you can use a [button](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_MESSAGE_COMPONENTS/buttons) with a [premium style](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_MESSAGE_COMPONENTS/button-object-button-styles) and a `sku_id` attached. You may also use these buttons to present users with options to make a [One-Time Purchase](#DOCS_MONETIZATION_IMPLEMENTING_ONE-TIME_PURCHASES).

```javascript
return new JsonResponse({
    type: 4, // InteractionResponseType.CHANNEL_MESSAGE_WITH_SOURCE
    data: {
        content: "This command requires Nelly Premium! Upgrade now to get access to these features!",
        components: [{
            type: MessageComponentTypes.ACTION_ROW,
            components: [
                {
                    type: MessageComponentTypes.BUTTON,
                    style: 6, // ButtonStyleTypes.PREMIUM
                    sku_id: '1234965026943668316',
                },
            ],
        }]
    },
});
```

## Using the Subscription API

In addition to the Entitlement API, you can use the [Subscription API](#DOCS_RESOURCES_SUBSCRIPTION) to manage the lifecycle of your app subscriptions. This API allows you to list all subscriptions for your app for reporting purposes and to check on the status of subscriptions.

> info 
> When implementing monetization in your app, you should consider Entitlements to be the source of truth for a user's access to a specifuc SKU. The Subscription API is intended for reporting and lifecycle management purposes that happen outside the flow of a user's interaction with your app.

## Testing Your App Subscription Implementation

> preview
> We are working on new and improved methods for you to effectively test your monetization features.

### Testing Your Implementation with Test Entitlements

You can test your implementation by [creating](#DOCS_RESOURCES_ENTITLEMENT/create-test-entitlement) and [deleting](#DOCS_RESOURCES_ENTITLEMENT/delete-test-entitlement) entitlements. These entitlements will allow you to test your premium offering in both a subscribed and unsubscribed state as a user or guild. 

> info
> Test Entitlements do not have a `starts_at` or `ends_at` field as they are valid until they are deleted.

### Testing Payment Flow with Live Entitlements

If you'd like to test the full payment flow for your app, you can do so by interacting with the `Upgrade` button. Any team members associated with your app will automatically see a 100% discount on the price of the subscription, allowing you to purchase without the use of live payment method. 

After checkout, you will have a live subscription that includes a `starts_at` and `ends_at` value. If you cancel this subscription, it will remain an active entitlement until the `ends_at` timestamp. This subscription will renew until cancelled and can be used in testing subscription renewals in your app.

> info
> You can only delete entitlements created using the [create entitlement](#DOCS_RESOURCES_ENTITLEMENT/create-test-entitlement) endpoint. If you need to toggle access to your premium features during your development process, it is best to use Test Entitlements.
