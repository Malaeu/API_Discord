# Welcome to the Discord Developer Platform

The Discord developer platform lets you develop apps to customize and extend Discord for millions of users. A toolkit of [APIs](/docs/reference/) and [resources](/docs/topics/community-resources) pair splendidly with a supportive community to help you build bots, integrate 3rd party services, and add Discord support to your game.

## Explore the Platform

#### Engage with Users

Add interactivity to your app with [commands](/docs/interactions/application-commands) and [message components](/docs/interactions/message-components) to build engaging experiences in the place where users are already hanging out.

#### Customize Servers

Customize Discord servers by using apps to do things like [send messages](/docs/resources/channel#create-message), modify [channels](/docs/resources/channel) and [guilds](/docs/resources/guild), [integrate with AutoMod](/docs/resources/auto-moderation), or [connect to voice](/docs/topics/voice-connections).

Plus, use the [Gateway API](/docs/topics/gateway) to respond to [real-time events](/docs/topics/gateway-events#receive-events) happening in a server, like when a reaction is added to a message.

#### Connect Metadata

Link and update metadata to enhance Discord for users. Add [Rich Presence](/docs/game-sdk/activities) to display live data on users' profiles, or [connection metadata](/docs/resources/application-role-connection-metadata) to make it easy for admins to create roles using metadata associated with your app.

#### Build Interactive Activities and Games

Currently in Developer Preview, the [Embedded App SDK](/docs/developer-tools/embedded-app-sdk) allows you to build [Activities](/docs/activities/overview), such as multiplayer games or social experiences, that run inside Discord.

## Discover Developer Resources

#### Find Tools and Libraries

The Discord developer community has built and maintained a ton of different [libraries and tools](/docs/topics/community-resources#libraries) over the years. No matter your experience level or language of choice, there are resources to speed up and simplify app development for you over on the [Community Resources](/docs/topics/community-resources) page.

You can also check out our [Postman collections](https://www.postman.com/discord-api) to try and test API endpoints.
