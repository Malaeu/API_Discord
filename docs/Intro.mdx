# Welcome to the Discord Developer Platform

The Discord developer platform lets you develop apps to customize and extend Discord for millions of users. A toolkit of APIs and resources pairs perfectly with a supportive community to help you build bots, integrate 3rd party services, and add Discord support to games.

## Discover the platform

### Engage with Users

Add interactivity to your app with [commands](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS) and [message components](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_MESSAGE_COMPONENTS) to build engaging experiences in the place where users are already hanging out.

### Customize Servers

Create custom experiences by using apps to [send messages](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/create-message), modify [channels](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL) and [guilds](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD), [create emoji](#DOCS_RESOURCES_EMOJI/create-guild-emoji), or [connect to voice](#DOCS_TOPICS_VOICE_CONNECTIONS). Plus, use the [Gateway API](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY) to respond to [real-time events](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/receive-events) happening in a server, like when a reaction is added to a message.

### Connect Metadata

Link and update metadata to enhance Discord for users. Use [Rich Presence](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_ACTIVITIES) to display live data on users' profiles, or [connection metadata](#DOCS_RESOURCES_APPLICATION_ROLE_CONNECTION_METADATA) to make it easy for admins to create roles using metadata associated with your app.

## Explore Developer Resources

### Find libraries and tools

The developer community has built and maintained a ton of different [libraries and tools](#DOCS_TOPICS_COMMUNITY_RESOURCES/libraries) over the years. No matter your experience level or language of choice, there are resources to speed up and simplify app development for you over on the [Community Resources](#DOCS_TOPICS_COMMUNITY_RESOURCES) page.
