## Getting Help

If you believe you're experiencing a bug with our API or want to report incorrect documentation, open an issue on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/discordapp/discord-api-docs/issues).

For a more real-time avenue of communication, check out the [unofficial, community-driven Discord server for developers](https://discord.gg/discord-api). There you'll find community members who can help answer questions about our API, community libraries, bot creation, and other development questions.

## Applications (aka Apps)

Making an app on Discord opens up many possibilities for deeper integrations with your other services and platforms.
Here are some examples to whet your appetite:

* Using your Discord account to safely login to your guild's website
* Display whoâ€™s online or in-game on your website or forum
* Automatically join private Discord servers or gain new roles based on external website permissions
* Other neat things.

Head over to our new [applications page](#MY_APPLICATIONS/top) to dive into creating your own custom juice.

## Games (aka Games)

There are a couple ways for games and their developers to work with Discord. [Rich Presence](https://discordapp.com/rich-presence) is a great way to more deeply integrate with Discord. It lets you:

- Show more detailed status information on your players' profiles
- Allow your players to create invites in Discord for others to play with them
- Launch into game sessions, parties, and groups directly from Discord
- Launch into your game's spectate mode directly from Discord
- Allow your players to ask to join their friends' games

Rich Presence is free, open-sourced, and self-serve, so check out [the How To guide](#DOCS_HOW_TO/) and get started!

We also have a Voice and Text Chat SDK to power in-game communication. This SDK is in private beta. If you're interested in using Discord to power your game's chat features, [apply for access](https://discordapp.com/gamebridge).

We can't wait to see what you make!
